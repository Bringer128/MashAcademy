MashAcademy
===========

See a demo at http://www.hackr.academy/

A proof of concept website developed for GovHack Perth 2014 for getting kids interested in mashing and hacking data.

Hacked together over a weekend, we hope that this tool could be used as inspiration for a product that could be used in the Australian school curriculum to get kids interested in data and to support learning outcomes.
